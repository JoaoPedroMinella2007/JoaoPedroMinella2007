ğŸ‘‹ Hello, my name is JoÃ£o Pedro Minella. Iâ€™m interested in object-oriented languages like Java, and Iâ€™m currently very into databases. Iâ€™m learning advanced concepts in Java and working with MySQL.

Fun fact: Iâ€™m an instrumentalist and love playing musical instruments. You can reach me at pedrominella123@gmail.com.
